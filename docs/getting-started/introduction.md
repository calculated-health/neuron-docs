## What is Neuron?

::: tip Neuron

A Neuron ([nur AAN](http://audio.pronouncekiwi.com/Salli/Neuron)) is an information messenger in the brain.\
They use electrical impulses and chemical signals to transmit information between different areas of the brain, and between the brain and the rest of the nervous system.

Neuron is a population health insights data engine, designed for the modern cloud and capable of processing robust amounts of population level datasets at blazing fast speeds.

## How it works.

Neuron is built on top of [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), a distributed data processing framework designed to handle petabyte level data loads.  It is designed to work with the most popular cloud service solutions such as [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/), [Azure Synapse](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/synapse-analytics/), [AWS EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/), [GCP Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc) or your own custom on-prem solution through [Kubernetes](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/running-on-kubernetes.html).

You simply deploy it to your cloud or on-prem environment, configure it through YAML files, point it to your data warehouse and run it.
