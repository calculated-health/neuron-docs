# Job Parameters

Job parameters are passed in as application CLI arguments to the Spark job or through ENV variables.     

::: warning NOTE
These params DO NOT live in the `.yaml` config file. They are used to configure how
the application will read the config file from its corresponding storage service.

Neuron is capable of supporting more environments than the ones listed below. However, we have not 
published them yet as we are still testing. We will continue to publish more environments
in the future. If you are in need of a different environment sooner, [contact us](https://www.calculated.health/#contact-us) to see 
if we can prioritize it for you.
